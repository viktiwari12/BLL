NOTE:  The only purpose is, Yopu should be able to convert your logic to into code. 

1) Two sum 

1 2 3 4 5 6 6 7 8   tar = 10

2) Three sum 


3) Convert a number for decomal to binary 

4) convert a binary number to decimal 

5) Generate Subsequence/subset ( Hint : try using the concept of binary)

6) Wave Traversal of Matrix 

7) Given an Interger array => Form the number 

8) Given an Integer  (1456263460) and a target dig = 6 (always one dig) calculate it's frequency 


9) sum of two arrays ( by forming the number) // make sure the ans should be in array 

1 2 3  => A = 123
4 4 6  => B = 446  : SUM = A+ B; 


10) form the reverse of a number ( Note :- You are not allowed to use array )A =  12345 =>   B = 54321
